## Profile Creation

Profile is where tastes are saved. To be easily recognizable, we might add an image + a name
It may contains information about allergen.
How to inform tastes & allegen ?
For allergen: use pictograms
For tastes, use a search field for ingredient (wheat, kirsh), composition (alcohol, raw egg), group (cheesecake, crumble), recipe.
It let user easily pick a known item to be banned.
We can also imagine a semi-random selection of cake and ask user if it match his tastes. (select those who are likely to be loved and those who are likely to be repulsed).
User could send a link to friends so they can directly edit their profile.
