How to present progress through selection?
## Epic: Cake Selection
1. confirm participants
2. confirm cake time (deadlines)
3. confirm filters
4. choose between cakes (could be > 1 if lots of participants)
5. add topping/dressing
6. confirm subrecipes
7. vote progression

1) is a one time setup: it will unlikely change after first setup. 4) depends on 1)
2) same as 1)
3) likely to changer after viewing suggestions - to adjust them
5) depends on 4)
6) depends on 5)
7) is an intermediary state between 4) & 5)

groups:
- [1, 2] -> suggestion setup
- [3, 4] -> cake choice
- [7] -> vote progression
- [5] -> plus extra
- [6] -> last options

## Stories
### Suggestion Setup
Goal: setup context: who will participate and when ?
User choose who will eat by adding profile or by giving the number of guest.
If the profile is not known by the app, it let the user create a new profile.
When creating a profile, the user will want to recognize it.
