How to present progress through selection?

## Epic: Cake Selection

1. confirm participants
2. confirm cake time (deadlines)
3. confirm filters
4. choose between cakes (could be > 1 if lots of participants)
5. add topping/dressing
6. confirm subrecipes

1) is a one time setup: it will unlikely change after first setup. 4) depends on 1)
2) same as 1)
3) likely to changer after viewing suggestions - to adjust them
4) depends on 4)
5) depends on 5)

groups:

- [1, 2] -> suggestion setup
- [3, 4] -> cake choice
- [5] -> plus extra
- [6] -> last options

## Stories

### Suggestion Setup

Goal: setup context: who will participate and when ?

User choose who will eat by adding profile or by giving the number of guest.
If the profile is not known by the app, it let the user create a new profile.
User will want to access all the feature of profile creation, especially tastes.
Profile added can be easily edited.

To better suggest cake, user has to inform when cake has to be ready. Default to next saturday.
