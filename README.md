Cooking cake is cool. But it requires some planning:

- You may have not have all the necessary ingredients or ustensil
- It may requires more time than you thought or it needs upward preparation
- You have no idea of which cake you want, which everyone enjoy
- You may have to compute quantities to match the size you want
